013	temporary	infrequently used	60 instances in UNC catalog on 2019-06-14. Most look like miscoded fields. Also of limited public use?
016	temporary	low priority	"Over 244,000 instances in UNC catalog on 2019-06-14. Could map to misc_id, but this was initially considereed a low priority."
017	temporary	infrequently used	"154 instances in UNC catalog as of 2019-06-14. At least in our catalog, users can't expect to find this information consistently. Could map to misc_id if necessary."
018	permanent	of limited use to typical user	Unique identification code for component parts appearing in monographs or continuing resources. Cryptic. Unlikely to assist with discovery.
025	permanent	internal	Internal to Library of Congress. Means nothing for our institutions.
026	permanent	internal	"Used to assist in the identification of antiquarian books by recording information comprising groups of characters taken from specified positions on specified pages of the book. Example: 026 ##$ae-s- 11as$bs,me crth 3$c1797.$dv.1"
031	temporary	infrequently used	"Only 5 instances of field in UNC catalog on 2019-06-14. Very cryptic and would take a lot of work to transform into something useful to end user. Could be useful in an eventual specialized music discovery tool, but this information might be coded elsewhere in the record in more usable ways."
032	permanent	internal	Number assigned to a publication for which the specified postal service permits the use of a special mailing class privilege.
033	temporary	of limited use to typical user	"15,564 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-06-14. Could be useful, but this isn't really a chronological *subject* and it's not a publication, etc. date either. Would need to make decisions about whether this is useful for discovery and how to best use it."
034	temporary	of limited use to typical user	"56,450 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-06-14. Could be useful in specialized cartographic discovery tool, but doesn't contribute much in the context of our general discovery application. Cryptic, not easily translated into user-sensible display. Information is usually recorded in less structured, more user-readable way elsewhere in record."
036	temporary	infrequently used	"5 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-06-14, all miscodings. Could fairly easily be mapped to misc_id if anyone else had more of this data and thought users would expect to search on or find this data in the catalog."
037	temporary	of limited use to typical user	"In general, it seems most users would not know or search for stock numbers in our online catalog. Could be mapped to misc_ids field if there's a use case for including this"
038	permanent	infrequently used	3 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-06-14. Highly unlikely to be kept updated/consistent in a library catalog. Of limited use for typical library discovery.
040	permanent	internal	Users don't care about the cataloging history of a record.
042	permanent	internal	Cataloger use only
043	temporary	redundant	Choice of geographic area code is usually based on the geographic names and/or subdivisions in 6XX subject added entry and index term fields. Revisit this decision if that practice ever changes.
045	temporary	complex	"This could be very useful for discovery, but it'd be challenging to do it well. The field means something different for different formats, so we'd need to present it differently per format. Also the data is recorded in a cryptic way that would require complex transformation. Finally, we'd need to figure out how to present different types of dates (dates depicted, dates of content, dates of data generation, date of original composition (music), etc.)"
046	temporary	complex	"Could be useful, but the assumptions of the current catalog include one main publication date. We have few materials that need to use this field in lieu of 008 because of BCE dates. Would need to tangle with how to usefully surface inclusive/bulk dates in UI."
048	temporary	complex	"Structured, coded form of data usually recorded in a human-readable, less machine-actionable form elsewhere in the record. If we ever support more advanced limits/structured searching for music display, map this field."
051	permanent	irrelevant	Our items are not in LC collections
052	temporary	needs review	"62,859 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. In many cases, appears to be an alternate method of encoding information already recorded in other fields we ARE mapping/using already"
055	permanent	irrelevant	Classification scheme not used in significant/meaningful way in our libraries
060	temporary	low priority	"NLM call numbers from ITEM OR HOLDINGS RECORDS should be being handled properly. Using bib 060 data might be of interest to our Health Science libraries for ebooks which may not have call numbers in items/holdings. This will only be useful AFTER there is a call number search/browse that handles NLM, however"
061	permanent	irrelevant	Our items are not in NLM collections
066	permanent	internal	Users don't need to see cryptic codes about scripts used in MARC records

080	permanent	irrelevant	Classification scheme not used in significant/meaningful way in our libraries
082	temporary	low priority	"DDC call numbers from ITEM OR HOLDINGS RECORDS should be being handled properly. Using bib 082/092 data might be of interest to our libraries using Dewey for ebooks which may not have call numbers in items/holdings. This will only be useful AFTER there is a call number search/browse that handles DDC, however"
083	temporary	low priority	"36 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31, several of them miscoded. If 082 is ever mapped from bibs, consider mapping 083 to support polyhierarchical classification"
084	permanent	irrelevant	Classification scheme not used in significant/meaningful way in our libraries
085	permanent	irrelevant	*Deity* protect us from ever having to code/use this field in MARC
086	temporary	low priority	"SUDOC call numbers from ITEM OR HOLDINGS RECORDS should be being handled properly. Using bib 086 data might be of interest to our libraries for e-gov docs which may not have call numbers in items/holdings. This will only be useful AFTER there is a call number search/browse that handles SUDOC, however"
242	temporary	low priority	"627 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. Could be mapped as title_variant, type:variant, label:Translation of title"
243	temporary	low priority	2 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. Could be incorporated in logic for creating this_work field if desired
256	permanent	of limited use to typical user	"Data in this field tends to be recorded elsewhere now. This field contains a lot ofdetails that maybe seemed important in the early 1990s, but that no one really cares about in an online catalog --- the fact that a web page is ""HTML encoded,"" or a file is ""ca. 70 kilobytes,"" for instance"
258	permanent	irrelevant	No specialized postage collections here?
263	permanent	of limited use to typical user	"If a to-be-published thing is not published yet, it's probably not available to our users. If it has been published, our users care about the 260/4 date, not this, which does serve an important function in pre-publication CIP records (this field is supposed to be removed from CIP records after an item is published, but that doesn't always happen)"
270	permanent	of limited use to typical user	"Not kept up-to-date when contact information changes. In general, we want our users to contact *us* when they have questions or issues about a resource, not some external contact."
306	permanent	data unusable	"Usually duplicates data recorded in 300 and/or 505. Recorded in a cryptic manner and there's no way to specify which duration recorded goes with which part of the described item, if it's a multi-part thing"
307	permanent	irrelevant	"No fields in UNC catalog. Hours an item is available is kind of a weird concept in the catalog, too."
336	temporary	low priority	Terms used are not user-friendly; this information is usually better expressed elsewhere in the record

341	temporary	needs review	New field introduced 2018-11. 0 occurrences in UNC catalog as of 2019-07-31. Could be important going forward if populated.
342	temporary	low priority	"Complex data mapping; appears in <2000 records in UNC catalog on 2018-05-21. Need to assess if this adds useful info, and if so, how to map."
343	temporary	infrequently used	only 2 records in UNC catalog
348	temporary	low priority	Look into whether it should map to genre
355	permanent	irrelevant	No records in UNC catalog
357	permanent	irrelevant	No records in UNC catalog
363	permanent	data unusable	"Holdings-like hell format specifying exact dates; only 10 in UNC catalog, most look like they should be 362s"
365	permanent	of limited use to typical user	We don't want to show this to users. It cannot be kept up to date
366	permanent	of limited use to typical user	We don't want to show this to users. It cannot be kept up to date
370	temporary	infrequently used	22 fields in UNC catalog -- maybe one day map to a subject-ish geographical entry or something?
377	temporary	infrequently used	1 field in UNC catalog -- maybe one day map to language facet if it adds unique info
380	temporary	low priority	Look into mapping to genre
381	permanent	data unusable	"Mishmash of different kinds of data issuing body, arranged statement of music, version, or a geographic term with no coding that tells you what the data is"
383	permanent	duplicate data	"Currently duplicates data recorded in other parts of the record, particularly 130 and 240 fields."
385	temporary	low priority	Look into mapping to `note_general` with label `For audiences`
386	temporary	infrequently used	"Could eventually leverage in some ""Works by"" field, but only 248 fields in UNC's catalog today 2018-05-18"
388	temporary	infrequently used	Only 3 fields in UNC catalog on 2018-05-18. Eventually could be mapped as a chronological subject or something.
530	permanent	of limited use to typical user	Patrons do not care if item is available in another format if they cannot get to that format from our catalog. Midleading if not adjusted and kept current with our holdings
532	temporary	needs review	New field introduced 2018-11. Textual/human-readable version of information coded in a more structured way in 341. 0 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. Could be important going forward if populated.
542	temporary	needs review	"276 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. Initial decision to NOT map based on: historically NOT representing rights-holder in bibliographic descriptions --- seems potentially useful for internal library applications, but difficult to keep up-to-date across the board and not very useful for discovery. If the rights involve access restrictions, those are communicated to the end user in a 506"
552	temporary	low priority	0 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. Would be complex to transform into something that would make sense to a user in catalog display. Examples in MARC documentation aren't really enough to figure out what that logic would need to be
565	temporary	low priority	2 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. Would require special logic to transform into a note that makes sense in the display
583	permanent	internal	Only select librarians can interpret and understand what this field means. Important for internal library work. Irrelevant for discovery.
584	permanent	internal	0 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31.
588	permanent	internal	Public does not care what part of an item was used to create catalog description.
654	temporary	low priority	76 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. Would require field-specific logic to process the data into headings and facet values
658	temporary	low priority	73 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. Most of those look mis-coded
751	temporary	needs review	"Relatively new field, introduced 2017-12. 0 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. If it starts being populated in a useful way, perhaps it could be mapped to origin_place_facet / origin_place_search"
753	permanent	of limited use to typical user	"Contains values like ""|aIBM-PC|cDOS 3.0,"" ""|aWindows 3.1/95"" and ""|aMACINTOSH."
754	permanent	irrelevant	1 occurrence in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. Seems relevant to plant/zoological collections
758	temporary	needs review	"New-ish field introduced 2017. 0 occurrences in UNC catalog on 2019-07-31. Not sure if/how this is being populated and whether it might be useful. Could have potential useful mappings to related_work field, but figuring that out would be a bit complex, and it might duplicate information recorded elsewhere in the record (?)"
776	permanent	of limited use to typical user	"Patrons do not care if item is available in another format if they cannot get to that format from our catalog. If not adjusted and kept current with our holdings, can be misleading and result in a link that returns only the record the link was in (because we don't have the thing in any other formats)"

On the other, there is no clear standardization of how to use this field and that means the data in it is likely to become too messy to use for anything.
