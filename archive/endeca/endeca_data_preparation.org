#+TITLE: Preparation of Endeca-related data 

* endeca_dmod_elements.txt: list of unique elements from Endeca data model spreadsheet from the following tabs/columns (dmod_fields tab): 
| Tab          | Column                |
| Dimensions   | Endeca_Dimension_Name |
| Properties   | Endeca_Property       |
| EAD mappings | Endeca_Property       |
* Notice that data model spreadsheet is not in full agreement with some things in the actual Endeca configuration and extract separate lists of elements and information about them from the Endeca config.
** endeca_dimensions.tsv: Extract dimension names and behavior from serverc: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/Dimensions.xml, using top-level dimension nodes only.
*** Call Number Range dimension defined in: ./data/TRLN/config/pipeline/LCC_NLM_full.xml:  <DIMENSION NAME="Call Number Range" SRC_TYPE="INTERNAL">
*** Language dimension defined in: ./data/TRLN/config/pipeline/language_utf8.xml:  <DIMENSION NAME="Language" SRC_TYPE="INTERNAL">
*** Data on facet refinement behavior extracted from: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.refinement_config.xml
** endeca_properties.tsv: Extract property information from /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.prop_refs.xml
*** Sortable data extracted from: serverc: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.record_sort_config.xml
*** System primary key extracted from: serverc: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.record_spec.xml
*** Filter value extracted from: serverc: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.record_filter.xml
** endeca_config_elements.txt: From the lists of Endeca dimensions and propties derived from the Endeca configuration files, create a unique list of Endeca element names from the config
** endeca_indexing.tsv: Define which elements are searchable in which indexes, by extracting configuration from: serverc: /data/TRLN/config/pipeline/TRLN.recsearch_config.xml
** _endeca_indexing_reduced.tsv: derived from endeca_indexing.tsv via endeca_indexing_reduce.rb
* Identify list of elements in endeca_dmod_elements.txt that are NOT in endeca_config_elements.txt

* Everything in endeca_dmod_elements.txt but not endeca_config_elements.txt was either
** in endeca_config_elements.txt with slightly different name
** deleted from data model but left in spreadsheet and formatted with strikethrough text
** a special Segmented element, which we don't care about, as per the next step
* *Thus we now consider endeca_config_elements.txt to be the final, authoritative element list going forward*
* endeca_final_elements.tsv is created, initially duplicating endeca_config_elements.txt
** Remove elements with "Normalized" in the property/dimension name, since we assume Solr will be handling normalization. This results in removal of the following from endeca_final_elements.tsv:
 - Authors Normalized
 - Journal Title Normalized
 - Main Author Normalized
 - Main Title Normalized
 - Notes Normalized
 - Publisher Normalized
 - Series Normalized
 - Subjects Normalized
 - Titles Normalized
** Remove elements with "Vernacular" (and "Vernacular Segmented") in the name, since we assume we are handling vernacular data very differently in Solr. The following are removed from endeca_final_elements.tsv: 
 - Edition Vernacular
 - Edition Vernacular Segmented
 - Imprint Vernacular
 - Main Author Vernacular
 - Main Author Vernacular Segmented
 - Main Uniform Title Vernacular
 - Main Uniform Title Vernacular Segmented
 - Other Authors Vernacular Segmented
 - Other Titles Vernacular Segmented
 - Series Statement Vernacular
 - Series Statement Vernacular Segmented
 - Statement of Responsibility Vernacular
 - Statement of Responsibility Vernacular Segmented
 - Subjects Vernacular Segmented
 - Table of Contents Vernacular Segmented
 - Title Vernacular
 - Title Vernacular Segmented
 - Uniform Title Vernacular
 - Uniform Title Vernacular Segmented
 - Varying Titles Vernacular Segmented
** Remove these elements from endeca_final_elements.tsv: Title1, Title2, Title3, Title4 on the assumption that we'll have better ways to deal with relevance ranking for short titles.
** Add column mapping each config element name to an element in endeca_dmod_elements.txt, in order to facilitate future data merging from Endeca data model spreadsheet
* _endeca_final_elements_compiled.tsv is compiled by endeca_final_elements_compile.rb
 - Adds whether we facet on each element (if yes, then it is a Dimension in Endeca)
 - Adds column on searchability of each element
* endeca_prepipeline_name_to_dmod_element.tsv: create mapping of Endeca pre-pipeline labels to Endeca data model element names 
 - vernacular, segmented, and normalized-specific elements and prepipeline names removed.
* _endeca_prepipeline_name_to_element_info.tsv: compiled by endeca_prepipeline_name_to_element.rb
