= `publication_year` field

NOT displayed.

Used for:

* Sorting by date
* Publication year facet? (or setting value of that field)
* Advanced search publication year limiting

May be output in citations generated from TRLN Discovery.

== General rules

* prefer 008 date if possible
* if that is not available, attempt to extract a date from 260$c or 264\1$c
* valid minimum year: 500
* valid maximum year: this year plus 6 years (exception: we can set publication_year to 9999 in some cases to indicate ongoing-ness)
* if a date is less than valid minimum year or greater than valid maximum year, it is ignored
* uncertain dates not specific to century or decade (i.e. 1uuu or 2uuu) are ignored
* If it is a date range (including uncertain dates which imply a range), assign midpoint of range as the date (rounded down).

== Date type rules
Date type is from 008/06

MARC has complex rules for what date types are valid for specific types of materials. We are not checking this logic. We are using the 008 date coding as-is.

=== b - No dates given; B.C. date involved.
*Ignore for now.* Most of UNC's records with this date type look to be in error. It seems unlikely that we have many items with a B.C. date!


=== c - Continuing resource currently published
Currently published is defined as an item for which an issue or update has been received within the last three years.

We want to reflect there is relatively current content.

Use Date2 (should be 9999)

=== d - Continuing resource ceased publication
Use Date2 -- reflect date of newest content available

If Date2 is range, ensure start of range is > Date1

194519uu = 1972 (1900 (normal range start is < Date1, so use Date1 as start of range, 1999 as end)

1945196u = 1964 (range start is 1960, which is NOT < Date1)

19459999 = current year (at time of data transformation) -- if the 'd' type is the miscoding, and the resource is still ongoing, this puts the title relatively close to present in sort. If it's actually ceased, but the 9999 was not updated, this keeps the title from sorting with the most recent/currently received titles. 

=== e - Detailed date
Use Date1 value only (year)

20120232 = 2013

197611uu = 1976

=== i - Inclusive dates of collection
Use Date1

The reason we are not using a range is: remembering that `publication_year` is not displayed but 260/264 is:

The first sort order below looks better than the second:

.Using Date1
[options="header"]
|=====
|displayed dates|`publication_year` value
|1900 - 1999|1900
|1910 - 1950|1910
|1940 - 1949|1940
|=====

.Using midpoint of range
[options="header"]
|=====
|displayed dates|`publication_year` value
|1910 - 1950|1930
|1940 - 1949|1944
|1900 - 1999|1949
|=====


=== k - Range of years of bulk of collection
Use Date1

See DateType = i for explanation of why we use Date1 instead of midpoint of range

=== m - Multiple dates
*If Date2 is NOT 9999* use Date2

*If Date2 = 9999 or other unusable date* use Date1

19951999 = 1999

19669999 = 1966

uuuu1981 = 1981

1943197u = 1974

=== n - Dates unknown
We've found many records coded DateType n that *do* have usable dates in Date1 and/or Date2

If both Date1 and Date2 present and usable, find midpoint of range.

Else use whichever date value is present usable.

17859999 = 1785

18501900 = 1875

189u\\\\ = 1894

18uu18uu = 1849

=== p - Date of distribution/release/issue and date of production/recording session when different
Use Date2 if present and usable -- we care about the original date of a film, not when it was released on a given format

Fall back to Date1 if Date2 not present or usable

=== q - Questionable date
If both Date1 and Date2 present and usable, find midpoint of range.

Else use whichever date value is present usable.

\\\\1932 = 1932

10001199 = 1099

=== r - Reprint/reissue date and original date
Use Date2 if present and usable (date of original, which reflects age of intellectual content)

Fall back to Date1 if Date2 not present or usable

19661741 = 1741

1866uuuu = 1866

=== s - Single known date/probable date
Use Date1

1987\\\\ = 1987

198u\\\\ = 1984

19uu\\\\ = 1949

1uuu\\\\ = not set

=== t - Publication date and copyright date

Use Date1 (publication date)

=== u - Continuing resource status unknown

If Date2 = 9999 use that (assumed miscoded current item)

Use Date2 if present and usable. Else use Date1

20uu9999 = 9999

20uuuuuu = 2009 (If range end is greater than current year, substitute current year as range end)

uuuu2006 = 2006

== Variable fields 260 and 264
If the 008-based logic leaves `publication_year` empty, we attempt to extract a date from 260$c or 264$c if present.

If using 264, indicator 2 must = 1.

If there are multiple 260/264s, use the one coded with indicator 1 = 3. If none have that coding, use the one appearing last in the record.

Extract first occurrence of 4 consecutive digits, 3 digits followed by -, or 2 digits followed by --

If hyphens are present in date, treat it as a range and take midpoint.

Otherwise just set the date from the capture.

1999 = 1999

c1999 = 1999

-2018 = 2018

[197-?] = 1974 (Treat 197- as range 1970-1979 and take midpoint)

197-- = 1974

[2017];©2018 = 2017

[between 1950 and 1959?] = 1950 (takes first date found)
