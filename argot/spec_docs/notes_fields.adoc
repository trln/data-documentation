== Patterns of mapping MARC fields to Argot
=== One MARC tag-to-separate Argot field treatment
Some MARC note fields are extracted into separate, specific Argot fields. This is because:

* There is some special treatment for the field in the system; AND/OR
* We deem the data in the note to be different/important enought to set it apart from other notes, either in a separate area, or with a separate primary label.

Examples are:

* 505 Contents note (TOC from Syndetics overrides display of this field; if no Syndetics data present, show separate from other notes as Contents)
* 520 Summary note (Similar to 505) 
* 511 Participant or Performer Note (display as separate field)

=== Multiple MARC tag-to-Argot field for note category
Some MARC note fields fall into general categories that should be displayed with other data. For example:

* Notes about publication history or issuance should be displayed with publication details
* Notes about accompanying materials, physical description, or system requirements should be displayed with other physical description information
* Local copy/item specific notes need to be shown separately

=== General notes field in Argot
Other MARC notes fields are handled in a general notes field.

=== Ignored notes
Some notes are NOT displayed or indexed.

Details on all ignored notes fields below in ignored notes section.

== Behavior of notes in TRLN Discovery
=== Displayed notes
All notes extracted into Argot will be displayed.

=== Indexed note content

* Note content is searchable in the keyword index.
* *Some note fields are NOT indexed.* These fields do not appear to meaningfully contribute to discovering the item described by the record and/or would introduce noise into the index and results sets
* Note labels and other parts of notes fields that contribute more noise than discoverability are NOT indexed.

== Local notes
It will be up to individual institutions to decide how their local notes (590) field data is mapped to the Argot `note_local` field.

In Endeca, we had the option of mapping this to either the non-indexed `Notes` property (using prepipeline data label `590`) or the `Indexed Notes` property (using prepipeline data label `590_indexed`).

The `note_local` field provides the same flexibility. 

== Special patterns in notes field processing
=== Field-refers-to label (from $3) needed
See https://github.com/trln/data-documentation/blob/master/argot/spec_docs/_subfield_3.adoc[spec document for $3] for more details. 

=== Label generated from MARC tag and/or indicator value(s) and/or subfield definitions
Data in some note fields looks very weird without a label. http://search.trln.org/search?id=UNCb1240038[Here's an example record in SearchTRLN]:

NOTES

- 1943-64. 1 v.
- No earlier abstracts published?
- Title varies slightly.
- (GL)


The same MARC field is often used to record different types of data, with indicator coding controlling the meaning of the field.

Some subfields are used to record data that needs its own label in order for the data (and its relationship to the rest of the data in the field) to make sense.

We should use the coding of the MARC data to display data to end users in a meaningful way.

*Each MARC field's indicators and subfields are defined separately, so this type of processing will be very field-specific.*

==== 521 example 1

 521 2 _ $a6-12$bMorgan Reynolds Incorporated

Without generating a label using the MARC tag and indicator coding, we end up with a cryptic note displayed:

 6-12 Morgan Reynolds Incorporated

Or we can meaningfully label/display the info:

 For grade(s): 6-12. (source: Morgan Reynolds Incorporated)


==== 521 example 2
 521 1 _ $aAdult.$bBrodart

Should be displayed:

 For age(s): Adult. (source: Brodart)

=== Label created from $i

[WARNING]
.$i is not always a label
=====================================================================
In the following fields, $i is a non-label data element: 

- 514
- 542
- 552
- 583
=====================================================================

=== Something else
Of course some fields are just weird and complicated.

One example is the 518 where you have the option of putting a natural language note in the $a. OR you can bust up the information into separately coded elements where the $p sort of functions as a label.

* May need $3 label
** b7832943a: 	518 _ _ $3CD 2$oRecorded$d2004 November,$pAuditorium (Chiesa) di San Salvatore a Rodengo, Brescia, Italy.
** b7832943a: 	518 _ _ $3CD 1$oRecorded$d2001 October,$pIstituo di musica Antica Academia Monte Regalis, Mondovi, Italy.
* If $a, treat like basic textual note
** b1200040a: 	518 _ _ $a"Recorded in the formerly monastic church of St. Ottilie in MÃ¶schenfeld near Munich. Date of recording, May, 1967."
* If any subfields occur after $a, remove them and throw in a space -- these are probably mis-coded and should be cleaned up in the data, but are pretty innocuous and seem easy-ish to deal with
** b8966892a: 	518 _ _ $aBroadcast$dFriday, November 18 (10:01-11:00 p.m. Est), on ABC.
* If no $a... $o 

== Argot note pattern

* `label`: Optional. May be set from $3, $i, and/or MARC field tag + indicator values.
* `value`: *Required.* The note that will be displayed. If there is no `indexed_value` and `indexed` is not false, this is also the indexed note content.
* `indexed_value`: Optional. This should only be populated if:
** `indexed` == true; AND
** `indexed_value` needs to be different than `value`
* `indexed`: Optional. If not explicitly set, assumed to equal true. In other words, default assumption is that a note field will be indexed.
* `lang`: Script/language code for non-Roman values, to trigger special language parsing in Solr

[NOTE]
====
Only *some* Argot notes fields utilize the notes pattern.

Some notes use:

[NOTE]
====
I'm on the fence about where this belongs, though the `full display` column in the Argot fields.csv has it in "Other details > (item/copy-specific description cluster) > (no label)"

Separated out because I imagine this is something some institutions may want to treat differently.

It sometimes seems to be used for manifestation-level differences (i.e. all in a printing run would have same pagination error or advertisement included). However, sometimes it looks to be used for literal copy-specific notes (which would be local).

I probably wouldn't do anything special. This field doesn't even make sense without a $a, so I suspect any instances missing a $a need to be deleted or corrected anyway. There shouldn't be too many of them.

*** `label` from $p
*** `value` from other specified subfields
*** `indexed_value` from $a, $t, $k

* field lacks $p (UNCb4916807)
** `label` constant value "Original version:"
** `value` from specified subfields
** `indexed` false

The above logic may seem a bit arbitrary---why not check for presence of $a, t, or k first? Without a $p, $a and other subfield coding/content becomes untrustworthy and we cannot assume $a, t, or k should be indexed. 

*Label from $3*
If $3 is present, prepend its value to label assigned via above logic (UNCb9094522)

[NOTE]
====
I'm on the fence about where this belongs.

It sort of makes sense with "This item includes".

It also sort of makes sense with physical description details or general notes.

It also seems like the kind of thing that institutions might want to display in different ways, which is a main reason I pulled it out as a separate, specific note field.

== Ignored notes
=== 524 - Preferred Citation of Described Materials Note
UNC catalog use = 23 fields

Field has been around since at least 2008 (and not updated since)

Users unlikely to look in full record to find out the preferred way to cite something. Also, we don't know what citation format they are being required to use.

b5250152a	567 8 _ $aThe Protocol for Assessing Community Excellence in Environmental Health (PACE EH) offers local health officials guidance in conducting a community-based environmental health assessment and creating an accurate and verifiable profile of the community's environmental health status. The process is designed to improve decision making by taking a collaborative community-based approach to generating an action plan that is based on a set of priorities that reflect both an accurate assessment of local environmental health status and an understanding of public values and priorities. The methodology takes the user through a series of tasks to engage the public, collect necessary and relevant information related to community environmental health concerns, rank issues, and set local priorities for action. At the heart are three core processes: developing new relationships with community stakeholders, expanding understanding about the relationship between human health and the state of the environment, and redefining a leadership role for public health officials in environmental health.
