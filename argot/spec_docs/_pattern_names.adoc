= Names pattern

The pattern used to create fields for names recorded in the catalog record.

Names recorded in a catalog record include personal, corporate body, and conference/meeting names.

This is called the `names` pattern instead of the author pattern because the names recorded in a catalog record may represent authors, other work creators (such as composers or artists), contributors (such as arrangers or conductors), manufacturers, publishers, and entities playing other uncategorized roles (owner or former owner of the item described; person who donated or inscribed the item described; etc.).

This pattern is used in the following Argot fields:

* https://github.com/trln/data-documentation/blob/master/argot/spec_docs/names.adoc[names]

toc::[]

== The pattern: Argot elements

[NOTE]

* https://github.com/trln/data-documentation/blob/master/argot/spec_docs/_field_X11.adoc[spec doc on X11 MARC fields]

The set of tests I created assumes that the details of extracting the name portion of X00, X10, and X11 fields has been worked out already (for use in fields using the https://github.com/trln/data-documentation/blob/master/argot/spec_docs/_pattern_work_entry.adoc[work_entry pattern]) and can be reused, so I'm not trying to test all permutations here.

====

=== `name`
This is the full name (with any qualifiers) from the source MARC field

* string
* *required*

Hyperlinked in display to perform author query.

If the name is of a `type` mapped to the author facet, only the `name` portion is included in the facet value.

==== Processing notes

* Strip ending punctuation (.,) and spaces

=== `rel`
The relator term(s) included in the name entry. Specifies the relationship of the agent represented by the name to the item described.

* array/repeatable
* not required - may be empty

Displayed but not part of hyperlink or resulting query, since names in legacy data are likely to lack relator terms and the search should not be over-specific.

==== Processing notes
The following steps should be done in order:

* Strip punctuation and spaces from beginning and end of field. Expected punctuation includes period and comma. 
* Replace relator *codes* with relator *terms* using marc-to-argot/lib/translation_maps/shared/relator_code_to_term.yaml
** If relator code is not mapped to a relator term in that file, drop that relator. Also see "MARC-to-Argot warnings/logs" section below.
* Strip WEMI terms (may be parenthetical) from relator *terms* if present: work, expression, manifestation, item
* Deduplicate the resulting array (sometimes both the term and the code for the same role is recorded)

=== `type`
Type, or category, of name.

* string
* required (if not explicitly provided, default to 'no_rel' (i.e. no_relator data)

Serves two major purposes:

* control creation of different indexed fields that can be relevance ranked differently (i.e. creators highest, contributors higher than 'other', etc.) in author search
* control which names get included in author facet

=== `lang`
Code identifying language/script for non-roman character fields.

See https://github.com/trln/data-documentation/blob/master/argot/spec_docs/vernacular_scripts.adoc#code-names-code[vernacular scripts documentation] for details.

[NOTE]
====
A different approach to `type` would be to have the `argot-ruby` flattener look it up based on relator values and do what it needs to do based on that result. This would have the benefit of slightly smaller Argot JSON files and perhaps faster MARC-to-Argot performance. Another benefit would be that changes to the relator-to-category mapping could be handled with a reindex, rather than a re-transform, re-ingest and reindex. 

However, I've opted to handle the `type` assignment in MARC-to-Argot rather than later in the data transformations for a couple of reasons:

* One of Argot's raisons-d'etre was to make diagnosing data problems easier. It is going to be *much* easier for data folks to troubleshoot issues/answer questions about behavior of data in the system if they can see the categorization result one step away from the MARC data.
* Error reporting on issues with relators makes the most sense at the initial data transformation step

====

==== `type` values

[NOTE]
====
Legacy MARC data often lacks the relator data required to assign `type` accurately.

We will know for sure that any name in 100, 110, or 111 is a creator (unless it has a relator that tells us differently).

Names in 7XX fields could be anything and are more likely to be contributors than creators, so names with `type`='no_rel' are treated like names with `type`='contributor'
====

* Highest relevance rank in author search, included in author facet
** `director`
** `creator`

[NOTE]
====
`director` is higher than `creator` to account for the fact that we want directors to specifically be mapped to a directors field.

The director is often also a screenwriter, and screenwriter maps to the `creator` category.

If we ranked `creator` above `director` here, such a director would be assigned `type`='creator' instead of type='director'

Aside: I went back and forth about whether, in such cases, there should be both a `creator` AND a `director` indexed field added, but I think that approach is likely to skew relevance in a weird way.
====

* Slightly lower relevance rank in author search, included in author facet
** `editor`
** `contributor`
** `no_rel` 

* Even lower relevance rank in author search, not included in author facet
** `owner`
** `other`
** `uncategorized`

* Lowest relevance rank in author search. Also include in publisher search. Do not include in author facet
** `publisher`
** `manufacturer`
** `distributor`

==== Processing notes

* If there are no `rel` values
** If MARC data source is 100, 110, 111
*** `type`='creator'
** Otherwise:
*** `type` = 'no_rel'

* Otherwise:
** Look up the relator category for each relator term in marc-to-argot/lib/translation_maps/shared/relator_categories.yaml
*** If relator term is not mapped to a relator category in that file, assign `type`='uncategorized'. Also see "MARC-to-Argot warnings/logs" section below.
** If the name falls into more than one category, assign the highest category in the `type` hierarchy as the `type` value
*** For example, the first name in the abstract example below has two relators terms: author (creator category) and illustrator (contributor category). Creator > contributor, so `type` = 'creator'.

== MARC-to-Argot warnings/logs
The specs show how to handle fields with:

* relator *codes* that do not have translations to relator *terms* for display
* relators that do not map to a relator category

We can do this gracefully, but it would be great if MARC-to-Argot could report out on these so that data folks can determine whether:

* the underlying data is wrong (typos, etc); or
* additional relator terms/vocabularies need to be mapped in MARC-to-Argot

[NOTE]
====
Current plan is to send `name` + `rel` to fields that will be included in both author and keyword indexes.

We want to test if inclusion of `rel` value in author index negatively affects relevance of names with a `rel` value when the query does not include the `rel` value. (Important since hyperlinks in the UI will NOT include `rel` values in their queries, will conduct author queries)

If this is seen as a problem, we may need to split the values included in author and keywork indexes into separate fields.
