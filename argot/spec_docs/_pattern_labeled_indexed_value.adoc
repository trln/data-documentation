= `labeled_indexed_value` pattern

The pattern used to create fields where:

* The value of the field should be displayed and indexed; but
* Sometimes there is data in the field that needs to be treated as a non-indexed (but displayed) label

This pattern is used in the following Argot fields:

* https://github.com/trln/data-documentation/blob/master/argot/spec_docs/other_argot_fields.adoc#edition[`edition`]
* https://github.com/trln/data-documentation/blob/master/argot/spec_docs/notes_fields.adoc#examples-note_binding[`note_binding`]
